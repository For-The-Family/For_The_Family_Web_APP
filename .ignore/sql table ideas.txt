Based on your JSON structure, a normalized database design with multiple tables would be beneficial. This structure will reduce redundancy, improve query efficiency, and organize the data in a way that allows for efficient querying on specific aspects (e.g., location, activities, facilities).

Here's a suggested schema with the tables and relationships for your kindergarten data:

1. kindergartens (Main table for each kindergarten)
    id (Primary Key, serial)
    name (VARCHAR(255), unique identifier for each kindergarten)
    street_address (VARCHAR(255))
    city (VARCHAR(255))
    postal_code (VARCHAR(10))
    geo_location (POINT for latitude/longitude, if supported, or separate columns for latitude and longitude)
    opening_hours (VARCHAR(50))
    minimum_age (INT)
    image_path (VARCHAR(255) for storing the path to the image)
2. activities (Table for possible activities)
    id (Primary Key, serial)
    activity_name (VARCHAR(50), name of the activity)
3. kindergarten_activities (Join table linking kindergartens with activities they offer)
    kindergarten_id (Foreign Key referencing kindergartens.id)
    activity_id (Foreign Key referencing activities.id)
    is_available (BOOLEAN to indicate if an activity is available)
4. facilities (Table for nearby facilities)
    id (Primary Key, serial)
    facility_name (VARCHAR(50), name of the facility)
5. kindergarten_facilities (Join table linking kindergartens with nearby facilities)
    kindergarten_id (Foreign Key referencing kindergartens.id)
    facility_id (Foreign Key referencing facilities.id)
    is_available (BOOLEAN to indicate if a facility is available)
Example SQL Code
This code will help set up the tables with the structure above:


-- Main table for kindergartens
CREATE TABLE kindergartens (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    street_address VARCHAR(255),
    city VARCHAR(255),
    postal_code VARCHAR(10),
    latitude DECIMAL(8, 5),
    longitude DECIMAL(8, 5),
    opening_hours VARCHAR(50),
    minimum_age INT,
    image_path VARCHAR(255)
);

-- Table for activities
CREATE TABLE activities (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    activity_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- Join table for kindergarten activities
CREATE TABLE kindergarten_activities (
    kindergarten_id INT REFERENCES kindergartens(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    activity_id INT REFERENCES activities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    is_available BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (kindergarten_id, activity_id)
);

-- Table for facilities
CREATE TABLE facilities (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    facility_name VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL
);

-- Join table for kindergarten facilities
CREATE TABLE kindergarten_facilities (
    kindergarten_id INT REFERENCES kindergartens(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    facility_id INT REFERENCES facilities(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    is_available BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY (kindergarten_id, facility_id)
);



Populating Data and Querying
    Inserting data: 
        First, insert each unique activity and facility into 
        the activities and facilities tables. Then, insert kindergartens 
        into the kindergartens table. Finally, use the kindergarten_activities
         and kindergarten_facilities tables to mark each activity or facility 
         as available or not for each kindergarten.

    Querying data:
        To get a list of kindergartens with certain activities or facilities available, 
        you can use JOIN queries on kindergarten_activities and kindergarten_facilities.
        This structure allows efficient queries for specific attributes without 
        loading unnecessary data, reducing server strain.

This setup will help ensure data integrity, optimize storage, and facilitate targeted queries, making the database more responsive for users.
